## Ingredients
- Lemons
- Honey or unrefined sugar
- Sterilized glass jar

## Instructions
Step 1 - Cleaning: The most important process in storing lemons is cleaning. First, rub the lemons with baking soda to remove dirt and sock lemons in the baking soda water for 30 minutes. Then, do a second cleaning with coarse salt to remove any residual chemicals on the surface. Finally, give the lemons a quick rinse in boiling water and wipe them with a towel.

Step 2 - Prepare the Lemons: Cut off the stem ends and slice the lemons as thinly as possible.
If the lemons have seeds, remove them to avoid a bitter taste.

Step 3 - Assemble the Jar: Start by placing a layer of honey at the bottom of the sterilized jar.
Layer the lemon slices on top. For better mixing later, add honey between several layers of lemon slices.
You can optionally add ginger or cinnamon for extra flavor, but for this recipe, we'll use only lemons

Step 4 - Finish and Store: Top off the jar with a protective layer of honey. Seal the jar with an airtight lid and cover it with a string or cloth.
After 3-4 days, store the jar in the refrigerator. If you used sugar, it’s recommended to leave the jar at room temperature until the sugar dissolves. However, if you used honey, you can refrigerate it after just one day.
