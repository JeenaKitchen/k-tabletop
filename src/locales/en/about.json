    "paragraph1": "Hi everyone, and welcome to Jeena’s Kitchen! I grew up in Korea, and I’ve been living here in Australia for the last 11 years. When I first settled in Sydney, I often found myself feeling a deep sense of longing at my own table. It wasn't the scenery of home I missed, but the comfort of my mother’s cooking and the simple joy of sharing a meal with friends. This feeling ignited a purpose in me: to connect people through the food I cook.",
    "paragraph2Title": "Bringing Home Cooking to the Community",
    "paragraph2": "Now, I focus on creating tablescapes using traditional Korean home-style recipes, adapted using the fantastic local ingredients we find here in Sydney, and shared with my family, friends, and neighbours. Through my YouTube and Instagram channels, I share not just the recipes themselves, but the genuine, warm stories and moments that happen around the table. I truly hope Jeena’s Kitchen becomes much more than a cooking channel—I want it to be a community built and connected by home cooking.",
    "paragraph3Title": "Sharing My Table  with Yours",
    "paragraph3": "Looking ahead, I plan to launch my own line of tableware and home accessories. This way, you can bring the beautiful, welcoming atmosphere of my tablescapes right into your home. I'll also be sharing honest and relatable stories about my family and the community I’ve found here in Australia, all tied together by food. My hope is that the plates, the dishes, and the stories you see will extend all the way to your dining room.",
