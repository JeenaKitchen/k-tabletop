    "paragraph1": "Hello, and welcome to Jeena's Kitchen.\n\nI was born and raised in Korea, and I moved to Australia 11 years ago.\n\nFor me, sharing the food I cook is more than just a conversation — it feels like a deep connection.\n\nA meal prepared with care can be an act of self-love, a source of comfort, and at the same time, a tender expression of affection toward family and friends.\n\nEven with cultural differences, food has allowed me to build bridges — to grow closer to friends and colleagues, and to create a sense of intimacy.\n\nNo matter how tough the day was, cooking has always been a moment of healing for me.",
    "paragraph2Title": "A Journey of Self-Discovery",
    "paragraph2": "Jeena's Kitchen is a space where I explore the thoughts, stories, and flavors that have shaped me.\n\nThrough cooking, I found a way to reconnect with the roots of my identity. At the same time, I discovered new ways of speaking to myself — learning what I truly enjoy and what brings me comfort.",
    "paragraph3Title": "Connect with the world",
    "paragraph3": "To me, Jeena's Kitchen is like a little lab — a place to reflect on how I can build healthier relationships with myself, with others, and with society, through food.\n\nI hope to continue learning and growing as a humble member of a multicultural community, while sharing the beauty of Korean food here in Australia. And through cooking, I wish to create a positive impact, both as a Korean and as part of the society I now call home.",
    "paragraph4Title": "Joy and Healing Through Cooking",
    "paragraph4": "Cooking can be playful, and in those moments of joy, the weight of a long or difficult day often fades away.\n\nI hope it can become that way for you too — a source of fun, healing, and inspiration.\n\nIf you ever find yourself thinking, \"I want to taste that,\" or \"I want to try making this,\" that would be the greatest happiness for me.\n\nWhether you're missing your mom's food, looking for comfort in a solo meal, or simply moving at your own pace — I hope Jeena's Kitchen can be a gentle pause, a warm space for you to rest."
