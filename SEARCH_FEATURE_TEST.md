# Recipe Search Feature - Testing Checklist

## Implementation Complete ✅

### Files Created:
1. ✅ `src/services/searchService.js` - Search logic and recipe aggregation

## Manual Testing Steps:

### 1. Basic Search Test:

2. Type "kimchi" in the search box
3. Press Enter or click search button
4. Verify dropdown appears with kimchi-related recipes
5. Click on a result
6. Verify navigation to correct recipe modal

### 2. Search by Ingredient:
1. Search for "gochujang"
2. Verify results include recipes containing gochujang in ingredients
3. Check that recipe descriptions are truncated if > 80 characters

### 3. Search by Description:
1. Search for "spicy"
2. Verify results include recipes with "spicy" in description

### 4. Keyboard Navigation Test:
1. Type a search query and press Enter
2. Press Arrow Down to select first result
3. Press Arrow Down again to select second result
4. Press Arrow Up to go back to first result
5. Press Escape to close dropdown
6. Verify search input is cleared

### 5. Click Outside Test:
1. Open search dropdown with results
2. Click anywhere outside the dropdown
3. Verify dropdown closes

### 6. Empty Search Test:
1. Type "zzzzzzz" (something that won't match)
2. Verify "No results found" message appears with search icon
3. Verify helpful subtext is displayed

### 7. Loading State Test:
1. Clear browser cache or use network throttling
2. Perform a search
3. Verify loading spinner appears briefly

### 8. Mobile Responsive Test:
1. Resize browser to mobile width (< 480px)
2. Verify search control takes full width
3. Verify dropdown is readable and properly sized
4. Test touch interactions on result items

### 9. Styling Consistency Test:
1. Compare search control with sound control and theme accordion
2. Verify all use same glass-morphism style:
   - `background: rgba(71, 71, 71, 0.177)`
   - `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`
   - `border-radius: 23px`
   - White text with text-shadow
   - Same hover effects (`scale(1.02)` or `scale(1.05)`)

### 10. Navigation Test:
1. Search for "bibimbap"
2. Click on result
3. Verify URL updates to `/k-tabletop/{theme-name}/bibimbap`
4. Verify recipe modal opens with correct content
5. Verify search dropdown closes after navigation

## Known Limitations:
- Maximum 10 results displayed (by design)
- Search is client-side only (no backend)
- Recipe data must be loaded before searching (handled gracefully)

## Performance Notes:
- Recipe data is cached in `searchService` after first load
- Search algorithm is O(n) where n = total number of recipes across all themes
- No debouncing on input (search only triggered on Enter or button click)

## Future Enhancements (Optional):
- [ ] Add search history
- [ ] Implement autocomplete/suggestions
- [ ] Add fuzzy matching for typos
- [ ] Add filters (by theme, category, cooking time)
- [ ] Highlight matching text in results
- [ ] Add "View All Results" button if > 10 results
