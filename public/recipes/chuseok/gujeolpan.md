## Ingredients
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 lb beef, julienned
- 1/2 lb shrimp, cleaned and sliced
- 1 cucumber, julienned
- 1 carrot, julienned
- 1/2 cup bean sprouts
- 1/2 cup spinach, blanched
- 1/2 cup mushrooms, julienned
- 1/2 cup bell peppers, julienned
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp sugar
- Vegetable oil for cooking

## Instructions
Step 1 - Make the crepes: Whisk together flour, eggs, water, and salt to make a thin batter. Heat a non-stick pan and cook thin crepes, one at a time. Stack and keep warm. These will be your wrappers.
Step 2 - Prepare the fillings: Julienne all vegetables into thin strips. Cook beef and shrimp separately with a little soy sauce and sesame oil. Blanch spinach and bean sprouts. Keep each ingredient separate and colorful.
Step 3 - Arrange in sections: Place each prepared ingredient in separate sections of a large platter or divided dish. The traditional gujeolpan has 9 sections arranged in a 3x3 grid pattern.
Step 4 - Serve and wrap: To eat, place a crepe on your plate, add small amounts of each ingredient in the center, and wrap like a burrito. Dip in soy sauce mixed with sesame oil and sugar.
