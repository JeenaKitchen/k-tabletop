## Ingredients
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 zucchini, thinly sliced
- 1 sweet potato, thinly sliced
- 1/2 lb beef, thinly sliced
- 1/2 lb shrimp, cleaned
- 1/2 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 2 green onions, chopped
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Dipping sauce: soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil

## Instructions
Step 1 - Prepare batter: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, eggs, water, salt, and black pepper until smooth. The batter should be thin enough to coat the ingredients lightly.
Step 2 - Prepare ingredients: Slice zucchini and sweet potato into thin rounds. Cut beef into thin strips. Clean shrimp and slice mushrooms. Arrange all ingredients on a large platter for easy access.
Step 3 - Fry the jeon: Heat vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Dip each ingredient in the batter and fry until golden brown on both sides. Work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
Step 4 - Serve and enjoy: Drain fried jeon on paper towels. Arrange on a serving platter and serve with dipping sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, and a drizzle of sesame oil.
