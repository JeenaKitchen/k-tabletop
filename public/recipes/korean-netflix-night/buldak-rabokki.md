## Ingredients
- 200g Korean rice cakes (tteok)
- 150g Korean instant ramen noodles
- 2 tbsp buldak sauce (Korean fire chicken sauce)
- 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean red pepper paste)
- 100g mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 2 green onions, chopped
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 500ml water or chicken broth
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 clove garlic, minced

## Instructions
Step 1 - Prepare the base: Bring water to boil in a large pan. Add rice cakes and cook for 3-4 minutes until they start to soften. The rice cakes should be tender but still have a slight chew to them.
Step 2 - Add noodles and sauce: Add the ramen noodles to the pot with rice cakes. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Mix in buldak sauce, gochujang, minced garlic, and sugar. Stir well to combine all flavors.
Step 3 - Reduce and thicken: Continue cooking for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce reduces and becomes thick and glossy. The liquid should coat the noodles and rice cakes nicely.
Step 4 - Add cheese and finish: Remove from heat and immediately sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Cover for 1-2 minutes to let cheese melt. Garnish with chopped green onions before serving.
