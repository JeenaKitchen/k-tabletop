## Ingredients
- 2 medium Korean eggplants (or Japanese eggplants)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup cornstarch
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
- 1 cup cold water
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Sea salt for finishing

## Instructions
Step 1 - Prepare eggplant: Slice eggplants into thin rounds (1/4 inch thick). Salt slices and let sit for 10 minutes to remove bitterness, then pat dry.
Step 2 - Make batter: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and chili flakes. Gradually whisk in cold water until smooth.
Step 3 - Heat oil: Heat oil to 350°F (175°C) in a deep pot or fryer.
Step 4 - Fry chips: Dip eggplant slices in batter, letting excess drip off. Fry in batches for 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with sea salt while hot.
