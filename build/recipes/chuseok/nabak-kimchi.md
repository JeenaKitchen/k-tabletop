## Ingredients
Main Vegetables:
- 1 small napa cabbage (about 1 kg)
- 1 medium Korean radish (mu), about 700 g
- 1 medium carrot (optional, for color)
- 3–4 green onions (scallions)
- 2–3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 2-3 small red chili pepper (optional, for garnish)
- 2-3 small green chili pepper (optional, for garnish)
- Half of Apple
- Half of Pear

Brine Cabbage:
- 500ml water
- 2 tablespoons coarse sea salt (for brining)

Seasoning Broth (Kimchi Water):
- 500ml water
- Around 130g Pear (half Korean pear)
- Around 130g Apple (one apple)
- Half onion
- 8 cloves garlic
- 2 Tbsp minced ginger
- 4 Tbsp Sea Salt to taste (about 1 teaspoon, adjust later)
- Sticky rice powder (2Tbsp) + 200ml water or 2-3 Tbsp cooked rice

Soaking chili powder in water:
- 4 tablespoons Korean red chili pepper flakes (gochugaru) — adjust to taste
- 500ml Water

Total Water Amount: 3~3.5L

## Instructions
Step 1 - Prepare the vegetables: Cut the napa cabbage into bite-size square pieces (about 2-inch(5cm)squares). Peel and thinly slice the radish into thin rectangles. Slice carrots into thin circle(optional). Cut green onions into 2-inch(5cm) lengths. Slice chili peppers thinly (optional, for mild spice and color).
Step 2 - Brine the vegetables: Dissolve 2 tbsp sea salt in 500ml water. Pour the brine over the cabbage and radish pieces in a large bowl. Let them soak for 1 hour, tossing occasionally. Do not drain and rinse with water. We will use the drained water as it is.
Step 3 - Soak the chili flakes: Place the red pepper flakes in a strainer and pour in the 500ml water. Let them soak for 10–15 minutes, stirring once or twice so the color releases evenly. Strain: Pour the soaked mixture through a fine mesh strainer, pressing gently with the back of a spoon or spatula. Extract only the bright red liquid, leaving behind the solid chili flakes.
Step 4 - Make the kimchi water: In a large bowl, combine 500ml water, add strained gochugaru, minced 8 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp minced ginger, half of Korean pear(150g), an apple (150g). Strain: Pour the soaked mixture through a fine mesh strainer, pressing gently with the back of a spoon or spatula. Extract only the bright liquid, leaving behind the solid mixture.
Step 5 - Assemble the kimchi: In a large glass container(Glasslock for Kimchi) or jar, layer the cabbage, radish, carrots, green onions, pears, apples, garlic, and chilli slices. Pour the kimchi water mixture over the vegetables until submerged. Add extra filtered water if needed to fully cover everything. Mix well and adjust salt to taste at the end — it should be slightly salty but not overwhelming.
Step 6 - Ferment and store: Leave the container at room temperature for about 1–2 days (depending on the temperature). When it starts to taste slightly sour and aromatic, move it to the refrigerator. It will continue to develop flavor — best served chilled after 4-7 more days.
