## Ingredients
- 1.2 kg boneless beef short ribs
- 1-2 carrots
- 1/3 or half radish
- 1 green onion
- 8 tbsp soy sauce
- 4-8 Medjool dates
- 1 tbsp minced garlic (add more if desired)
- 2 tbsp minced ginger
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- A pinch of black pepper
- Pureed pear (from 1/2 pear)
- 1 tbsp rice syrup or oligosaccharide (for gloss)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- Sliced chili (optional)
- Peppercorns (optional)

## Instructions
Step 1 - Make the sauce: Mix soy sauce, soaked dates, garlic, ginger, pepper, and pear puree in a bowl. Taste and adjust — it should be slightly salty and sweet.
Step 2 - Prep vegetables: Cut radish and carrot into large chunks. Slice green onion diagonally. Pit and halve the soaked dates.
Step 3 - Braise the meat: Place the ribs in a pot and pour in the sauce until it just covers the meat. Add sliced chili and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for 40-50 minutes.
Step 4 - Add vegetables: Add radish and carrot. Simmer for another 20-30 minutes until the sauce thickens and reduces by half. Finish with green onions and a drizzle of corn syrup for shine.
