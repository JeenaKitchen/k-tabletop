## Ingredients
- 6 slices of soft white sandwich bread (preferably Japanese milk bread or shokupan)
- 1 cup (240 ml) cold double cream (also called thickened cream)
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 9 fresh strawberries, washed and hulled (choose small, symmetrical ones)

## Instructions
Step 1 - Whip the Cream: In a chilled mixing bowl, whip the cold double cream with sugar until medium peaks form — the cream should hold its shape but remain soft.
Step 2 - Assemble the Sandwich: Spread a generous layer of whipped cream on one slice of bread.Arrange three strawberries in a straight line, tip-side down, in the center of the bread. If planning to cut diagonally, form a triangular or diamond pattern.Spread whipped cream on a second slice of bread and gently press it over the strawberries to form a sandwich.
Step 3 - Wrap and Chill: Tightly wrap the sandwich in plastic wrap.Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. This helps firm up the cream and allows for a clean cut.
Step 4 - Slice and Serve: Remove from the fridge, unwrap, and slice diagonally with a sharp knife.Wipe the blade between cuts for a neat presentation.
