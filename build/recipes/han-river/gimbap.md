## Ingredients
- 2 cups cooked short-grain rice
- 2 cups cooked short-grain rice
- 2 sheets of gim (dried seaweed)
- 1 can of Tuna Mayo (185g)
- Braised buckweet
- 1 cucumber (cut into thin strips)
- 1 carrot (julienned)
- 1-2 egg(s)Pickled radish (danmuji) strips1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp saltSesame seeds (for garnish)
- Cooking oil
- Crap Meat (Optional)
- Fish Cake (Optional)

## Instructions
Step 1 - Prepare the Rice: Mix the cooked rice with sesame oil and salt. Too much sesame oil may make the rice slippery to stick on seaweed. Please add a little bit. Let it cool to room temperature.

Step 2 - Prepare tuna: Squeeze out the water from the canned tuna. Add Mayonnaise for creamy texture to the tuna.

Step 3 - Cook the Vegetables: Julien carrot. Lightly sauté the julienned carrot in a bit of oil and set aside.
The cucumber can be used raw, but you can also blanch it quickly if you prefer.

Step 4 - Prepare the Eggs: Beat the eggs, add a pinch of salt, and cook them as a thin omelet in the pan.
Once cooked, slice the omelet into thin strips.

Step 5 - Assemble the Gimbap: Place a sheet of gim on a bamboo mat, shiny side down. Spread a thin layer of rice (around a handful of rice) evenly over the gim, leaving about 1 inch at the top. In the center of the rice, add a strip of Spam, a couple of egg strips, some cucumber, carrot, and pickled radish and so on.

Step 6 - Roll the Gimbap: Using the bamboo mat, carefully roll the gimbap, tucking in the fillings as you go.
Make sure to press firmly to keep the roll tight. Tightly roll all the fillings and the inner edge of the seaweed (the side closest to your body), then press it down once at the top, using the layer of rice as glue. And roll the pole sliding till the end of the seaweed.

Step 7 - Cut and Serve: Brush the roll with a bit of sesame oil to prevent the seaweed get soggy and to help the knife not sticky on your Gimbap when cutting Gimbap. Slice the gimbap into bite-sized pieces and serve!Enjoy your Tuna Mayo Gimbap with some kimchi or a dipping sauce of your choice!
